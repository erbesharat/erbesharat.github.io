[{"categories":null,"contents":"This is going to be a new beginning. I decided to start writing after a long time and this time everything is different. This time it\u0026rsquo;s my personal blog, not a magazine and also it\u0026rsquo;s gonna be in English. It will probably be a lot more challenging for me cause English is not my first language and also I\u0026rsquo;m planning to write a few series that are much more technical than my previous articles.\nThink I\u0026rsquo;m gonna start by writing a series about how to use TXTDirect on your local machine to add some fancy features to your work environment. Also I will probably write a few posts about the challenges we face daily in our projects and how we fix them.\nI would be glad if you could send your comments about the future posts to my email. Also don\u0026rsquo;t hesitate to ask any questions about my posts or our projects. After all OSS is all about helping each other :)\n","permalink":"https://erbesharat.github.io/blog/general/hello-world/","tags":null,"title":"Hello World"},{"categories":null,"contents":null,"permalink":"https://erbesharat.github.io/","tags":null,"title":"Home"},{"categories":null,"contents":null,"permalink":"https://erbesharat.github.io/","tags":null,"title":"erbesharat's Blog"},{"categories":null,"contents":null,"permalink":"https://erbesharat.github.io/blog/","tags":null,"title":"Blogs"},{"categories":null,"contents":null,"permalink":"https://erbesharat.github.io/categories/","tags":null,"title":"Categories"},{"categories":null,"contents":null,"permalink":"https://erbesharat.github.io/tags/","tags":null,"title":"Tags"}]
