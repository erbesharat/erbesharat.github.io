      <description>When I started working on my first issue on TXTDirect I had no idea how to even setup and use the project. Didn&amp;rsquo;t know anything about DNS and its concepts and was looking for a quick way to get familiar with the project. With the help of my colleagues I was able to start an instance CoreDNS and setup TXTDirect on my laptop. After running the dependencies and TXTDirect, it was the time to implement a simple scenario to see how it works.</description>

      <description>This is going to be a new beginning. I decided to start writing after a long time and this time everything is different. This time it&amp;rsquo;s my personal blog, not a magazine and also it&amp;rsquo;s gonna be in English. It will probably be a lot more challenging for me cause English is not my first language and also I&amp;rsquo;m planning to write a few series that are much more technical than my previous articles.</description>
